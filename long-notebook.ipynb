Finally, it encodes the 'location' column of the DataFrames into numerical values using LabelEncoder from scikit-learn, and returns two DataFrames: one with features (`X_train`) and another with both features and targets (`X_train_with_targets`).\n",

However given the feature name there is not that much information about the feature itself. Therefore we have decieded to look closer into the features and how they effect the power production of the solar panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct radiation (W)**: This parameter measures the amount of direct sunlight that reaches the ground. Direct radiation is the most effective type of sunlight for solar energy production, so a higher value would generally result in more energy being produced by photovoltaic cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Direct radiation 1h (J)**: Similar to direct_rad, this parameter measures the total amount of direct radiation energy within a one-hour period. This could be useful for assessing the potential for solar energy production over short periods of time, especially when direct sunlight is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clear sky radiation (W)**: This measures the solar radiation that would reach the ground under clear sky conditions. This is a theoretical maximum amount of solar radiation, assuming no clouds or other atmospheric interference. It serves as a benchmark to gauge how much energy could be produced under optimal conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Clear sky energy 1h (J)**: This parameter measures the potential energy production under clear sky conditions within a one-hour timeframe. A higher value would indicate more solar energy is available for capture. This would be a direct influence on the solar panel's efficiency, assuming no other environmental issues like dirt or dust on the panels.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Diffuse radiation (W)**: This measures the amount of diffuse radiation, which is sunlight scattered by particles in the atmosphere. Unlike direct sunlight, diffuse radiation comes from all directions. Solar panels can still capture this type of radiation, although typically at a lower efficiency compared to direct sunlight.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Diffuse radiation 1h (W)**: Similar to diffuse_rad, but it measures the total diffuse radiation energy within a one-hour period. This could be useful for understanding the variability in power generation over short periods of time, as diffuse radiation can be influenced by factors like cloud cover and atmospheric conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Sun elevation (d)**: This is the angle of the sun in relation to an observer's horizon. A higher angle (closer to 90 degrees) means the sun is directly overhead, which is generally more favorable for solar energy production. A lower angle means less direct sunlight and thus lower potential for energy generation. This parameter would be particularly important in regions with large changes in sun elevation throughout the year, such as high-latitude areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these features in a predictive model can help the model to better understand and forecast solar energy production. Each of these four features captures a different aspect of the environmental conditions that influence solar energy capture, and collectively they can provide a comprehensive view of solar energy potential. Understanding how these variables interact and influence solar energy output can be crucial for optimizing the efficiency of solar energy systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we have decieded to create different scatterplots given the features with the highest correlation and the target variable, in order to hopefully see a pattern."

    "\n",
    "1. **Relative Humidity 1000hPa (p)**: This parameter measures the moisture content in the air at a specific pressure level (1000 hPa). While humidity itself doesn't directly affect the efficiency of solar panels, it can influence cloud formation and atmospheric conditions. High humidity could potentially lead to cloud cover, which would reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Air Density 2m (kg/mÂ³)**: This measures the density of the air 2 meters above the ground. Air density can affect the transmission of sunlight, albeit minimally. Lower air density could mean less scattering and absorption of sunlight, potentially leading to slightly increased solar energy production.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Location**: The geographical location is crucial for solar energy production. It dictates many other factors such as the angle of sunlight, average weather conditions, and duration of daylight. For example, locations closer to the equator generally receive more direct sunlight, increasing the potential for solar energy production.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Is in Shadow (idx)**: This index  indicates whether a location is currently in shadow, perhaps due to buildings, trees, or other obstructions. Being in the shadow would significantly reduce solar radiation reaching the solar panels, thus reducing energy production. This would be an immediate and significant factor affecting solar energy output."
